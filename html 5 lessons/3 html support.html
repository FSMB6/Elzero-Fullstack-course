      //search for html shiv or
      //download the file from github via this link https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv
      //what will this File do is provide the support you need for all the new html5 elements
      //which old browser doesn't support and will not apply any styling on them
    </script>
<[end if]-->
    <!--The (if statement) above tills if the browser less than IE 9 (old) run the script above-->

    <script>
      //and this how to create element manually
      document.createElement("article"); //This element is already provided by html5, but we creating it as example
      document.createElement("custom"); //I made this by my own, This is how you make custom element
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <article>
      <section>article section</section>
    </article>
    <custom> First Custom Element yeay!! </custom>
    If I didn't create the element above by myself it wouldn't be styled in old
    browsers that doesn't support html5 <br />
    <strong>HTML5</strong> doesn't need elements to be created like you did in
    <strong>javascript</strong>
